# How to use the config
Simply add `Include <CLONE_DIRECTORY>/wato_ssh_config/wato` to your `~/.ssh/config` file[^1], where `<CLONE_DIRECTORY>` is the directory in which you cloned this repository.

[^1]: If you do not have such a file, simply create one: `touch ~/.ssh/config`. To learn about SSH config files, see this [article](https://linuxize.com/post/using-the-ssh-config-file/).
